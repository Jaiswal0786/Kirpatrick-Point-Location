# Kirpatrick Point Location

## Description

Kirkpatrick gives a data structure for point location in triangulated subdivisions with O(n) storage space and O(log n) query time. The general idea is to build a hierarchy of triangles. To perform a query, we start by finding the top-level triangle that contains the query point.

## How it Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a region name and vertices.
2. Vertices are processed, and some may be removed based on certain conditions.
3. The program then asks the user to input coordinates for a point to check if it lies within a region.
4. The result is printed, indicating whether the point is in the region or not.
5. The user is given the option to continue or exit the program.

## Example Output
